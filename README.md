# Yukon Road Trip Mobile Application

A React Native mobile application for Android and iOS developed by 247labs (subcontracted through Aasman) in 2019-20.


## Repository History

The `eservices/android-apk-build` branch was made at last commit by the original 247labs developer (f6c77d8d, 2019-09-25).
Sometime after that point, the second developer added large files which perhaps don't belong under source control.


## Missing Large Files

The following files were deleted from this repository to meet GitHub's filesize limits.
The originals are still in the
[YG eServices GitLab master repository](http://eserv-prd-scm01.ynet.gov.yk.ca/mobile/driving-app/yukon-react-native-mobile-app)
(VPN and explicit vendor access required).
