# Yukon Road Trip Mobile Application

A React Native mobile application for Android and iOS developed by 247labs (subcontracted through Aasman) in 2019-20.
The app was launched in the iOS App Store and Google Play store for the first time on February 1, 2021.


## Repository history

The `eservices/android-apk-build` branch was made at last commit by the original 247labs developer (f6c77d8d, 2019-09-25).
Sometime after that point, the second developer added large files which perhaps don't belong under source control.


## Build and deploy procedure

[Instructions for iOS and Android are attached](build-and-deploy-yukon-road-trip-mobile-app.md).
